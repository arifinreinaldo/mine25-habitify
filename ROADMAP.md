## Database Schema Updates Required

For new features to work, ensure your Supabase `habits` table has these columns:
```sql
ALTER TABLE habits ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS habit_type TEXT DEFAULT 'boolean';
ALTER TABLE habits ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS unit TEXT;
```

And your `completions` table has:
```sql
ALTER TABLE completions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS value INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE completions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS notes TEXT;
```
